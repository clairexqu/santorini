During the completion of Homework 6 my partner and I worked side by side about 95% of the time. 
We mostly worked in the same classes rather than splitting up the work.
We went to maybe 4-5 office hours together to work through our design. 
We utilized collaborative tools such as Live Share and Git. 
One significant benefit we discovered from working together was the ability to error check each other's code as we coded, resulting in cleaner code overall and less of a need to revisit code. 
Moreover, debugging became easier as we could rely on a partner who had an understanding of the codebase as opposed to going to office hours. 
Overall, the process was great.
